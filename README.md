# OPTIONAL-DEVLIVERY
final delivery of Minesweeper game for sprint1 - Coding Academy
i wasn't able to connect the onclick events to changing levels properly in my previous code, in this version i added some functions that where created to build board that change with respect to different inputs, and i changed/remove the code that was no longer needed, while keeping cetain things from my previous attempts at creating this game.
